       <h1> Our Mission </h1>
       <p>When I played soccer in high school, I felt lost in the recruiting process despite
         having amassed 20+ offers from the D3/NAIA level to D1.
          At the time, I had wished that there was a guiding hand
          and a way for me to get more exposure. I ultimately stepped away from the game;
          however, I made it my life's work 
          to make sure no more untapped gems of potential go under the radar. 
          So I founded Athletes of Tomorrow, a recruiting networking site
          that I use to match unpolished gems with top clubs or universities. 
          Our alum includes 20 professional athletes,
          50+ division one athletes, 
          and 300+ from D2 down to D3/NAIA and JUCO.</p>
